    <h3>YAMAHA MT09</h3>
<P/></P>The MT-09 is the first Yamaha motorcycle since the XS750 and XS850 to be powered by an inline-three engine. Both are shaft-driven motorcycles produced from 1976 to 1981. 
In 2017, the MT-09 was updated with fully adjustable suspension, traction control, ABS, slipper clutch, LED headlights and updated styling.</P>

<H3>KAWASAKI Z900</H3>
<P>Launched in 1972, the 900 Z1 - more commonly known as the Z 900 - has entered motorcycle history to become a mythical machine thanks to its incomparable line, 
    a subtle blend of sobriety and perfect elegance, and its dynamic performance that will outperform the reference Honda 750 Four</P>
